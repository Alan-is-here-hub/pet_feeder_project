## Project Overview
The automated feeder is designed to:
- Dispense food at scheduled times (**08:00 AM and 5:00 PM**).
- Provide **500g of food** per feeding, with a bowl capacity of **800g**.
- Monitor consumption using a **weight sensor** under the bowl.
- Alert the user if:
  - Food is not eaten within **60 minutes**.
  - The food bin is empty.
